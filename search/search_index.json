In this document, we\u2019ll take a closer look at how the range of a projectile depends on the launch angle. While the basic equations are simple, they reveal deep insights into motion and optimization. Understanding the Equations To analyze projectile motion, we start with Newton\u2019s laws. Assuming there\u2019s no air resistance, the only force acting on the projectile is gravity, which influences its vertical motion. Motion Equations Horizontal Position: Vertical Position: where: $ v_0 $ is the initial velocity, $ \\theta $ is the launch angle, $ g $ is gravitational acceleration. Time of Flight The projectile lands when $ y(t) = 0 $, giving: Calculating the Range The horizontal range $ R $ is: Using the identity $ 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta) $, we simplify: How Range Depends on Angle From the formula, the range reaches its maximum when $ \\sin(2\\theta) $ is largest, which happens at $ \\theta = 45^\\circ $. Effects of Other Parameters Increasing Initial Velocity: A higher $ v_0 $ increases range since $ R \\propto v_0^2 $. Stronger Gravity: A higher $ g $ decreases range since $ R \\propto 1/g $. Real-World Applications Projectile motion is more than just a theoretical exercise; it has real-world relevance: Sports: Optimizing angles in soccer, basketball, and javelin throws.
